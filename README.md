# speedtest_http
## Introduction

Flask/ dash web app for visualizing internet uplink speeds. So far supported
environments are:
* inside a docker container
* on GNU/Linux hosts with Python >= 3.6 installed

## Status

There are working examples for line plots and heatmaps but considering the
outstanding amount of tsting yet to be done, the project has clearly
alpa status.

Response time on oldeer hardware (or Rasperry Pi) is an issue,
it will need some investigative work!
